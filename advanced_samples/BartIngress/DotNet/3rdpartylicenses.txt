# END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR ACME SOFTWARE

IMPORTANT READ CAREFULLY: This ACME End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a
legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and ACME
Corporation for the ACME software product identified above, which includes
computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, and
"online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT"). The SOFTWARE PRODUCT
also includes any updates and supplements to the original SOFTWARE PRODUCT
provided to you by ACME. Any software provided along with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
that is associated with a separate end-user license agreement is licensed to you
under the terms of that license agreement. By installing, copying, downloading,
accessing, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the
terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install
or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; you may, however, return it to your place of
purchase for a full refund.

## SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright
treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE
PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following rights:

   - Applications Software. You may install, use, access, display, run, or
     otherwise interact with ("RUN") one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, or any
     prior version for the same operating system, on a single computer,
     workstation, terminal, handheld PC, pager, "smart phone," or other
     digital electronic device ("COMPUTER"). The primary user of the COMPUTER
     on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is installed may make a second copy for his

   - Reservation of Rights. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by
     ACME.

2. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.

   - Not for Resale Software. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled "Not For
     Resale" or "NFR," then, notwithstanding other sections of this EULA, your
     use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is limited to use for demonstration, test, or
     evaluation purposes and you may not resell, or otherwise transfer for
     value, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

   - Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly. You
     may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE PRODUCT,
     except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted
     by applicable law.

   - Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed as a single
     product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than
     one COMPUTER.

   - Trademarks. This EULA does not grant you any rights in connection with
     any trademarks or service marks of ACME.

   - Rental. You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

   - Support Services. ACME may provide you with support services related to
     the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Support Services"). Use of Support Services is
     governed by the ACME policies and programs described in the user manual,
     in "online" documentation, and/or in other ACME-provided materials. Any
     supplemental software code provided to you as part of the Support
     Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to
     the terms and conditions of this EULA.

   - Software Transfer. The initial licensee of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may make
     a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT only
     directly to an end user. This transfer must include all of the SOFTWARE
     PRODUCT (including all component parts, the media and printed materials,
     any upgrades, this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of
     Authenticity). Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any
     other indirect transfer. The transferee of such one-time transfer must
     agree to comply with the terms of this EULA, including the obligation not
     to further transfer this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

   - Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, ACME may terminate
     this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this
     EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
     and all of its component parts.

3. COPYRIGHT. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
   (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video,
   audio, music, text, and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT),
   the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
   are owned by ACME or its suppliers. All title and intellectual property
   rights in and to the content that may be accessed through use of the SOFTWARE
   PRODUCT is the property of the respective content owner and may be protected
   by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.
   This EULA grants you no rights to use such content. If this SOFTWARE PRODUCT
   contains documentation that is provided only in electronic form, you may
   print one copy of such electronic documentation. You may not copy the printed
   materials accompanying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

4. BACKUP COPY. After installation of one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pursuant
   to this EULA, you may keep the original media on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
   was provided by ACME solely for backup or archival purposes. If the original
   media is required to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on the COMPUTER, you may make
   one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT solely for backup or archival purposes.
   Except as expressly provided in this EULA, you may not otherwise make copies
   of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE
   PRODUCT.

5. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S.
   Government pursuant to solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995 is
   provided with the commercial rights and restrictions described elsewhere
   herein. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to
   solicitations issued prior to December 1, 1995 is provided with RESTRICTED
   RIGHTS as provided for in FAR, 48 CFR 52.227-14 (JUNE 1987) or FAR, 48 CFR
   252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), as applicable.

6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. This SOFTWARE PRODUCT has been classified by the US
   Government as exportable under License Exception TSU. Therefore the following
   terms apply: You agree that you will not export or re-export the SOFTWARE
   PRODUCT, any part thereof, or any process or service that is the direct
   product of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (the foregoing collectively referred to as
   the Restricted Components), to any country, person or entity subject to U.S.
   export restrictions. You specifically agree not to export or re-export any of
   the Restricted Components (i) to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed
   or restricted the export of goods or services, which currently include, but
   are not necessarily limited to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
   and Syria, or to any national of any such country, wherever located, who
   intends to transmit or transport the Restricted Components back to such
   country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or have reason to know
   will utilize the Restricted Components in the design, development or
   production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any person
   or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export
   transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. You warrant and
   represent that neither the Bureau of Export Administration nor any other U.S.
   federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges.

## MISCELLANEOUS

This EULA is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the
United States of America.

## LIMITED WARRANTY

ACME warrants that (a) the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will perform substantially in
accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90)
days from the date of receipt, and (b) any Support Services provided by ACME
shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to
you by ACME, and ACME support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts
to solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow
limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not
apply to you.

CUSTOMER REMEDIES. ACMEs and its suppliersentire liability and your exclusive
remedy shall be, at ACMEs option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or
(b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet ACMEs
Limited Warranty and which is returned to ACME with a copy of your receipt. This
Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from
accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be
warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,
whichever is longer.

NO OTHER WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACME AND
ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE
SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES.
THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH
VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no
event shall ACME or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,
damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability
to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the provision of or failure to provide Support
Services, even if ACME has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In
any case, ACMEs entire liability under any provision of this EULA shall be
limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE
PRODUCT or U.S. \$5.00; provided, however, if you have entered into a ACME Support
Services Agreement, ACMEs entire liability regarding Support Services shall be
governed by the terms of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions do
not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not
apply to you.

the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if
any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

- updates,

- supplements,

- Internet-based services, and

- support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms
apply.

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT
USE THE SOFTWARE.

---

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.

1.  INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

    a. Installation and Use.  You may install and use any number of copies of
    the software to design, develop and test your programs. You may modify,
    copy, distribute or deploy any .js files contained in the software as
    part of your programs.

    b. Third Party Programs.  The software may include third party programs
    that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this
    agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for
    your information only.

2.  ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.

    a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the
    software is comprised of Distributable Code. "Distributable Code" is code
    that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you
    comply with the terms below.

        i. Right to Use and Distribute.

            *  You may copy and distribute the object code form of the
              software.

            *  Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your
              programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of
              those programs.

    b. Distribution Requirements.  For any Distributable Code you distribute,
    you must

        *  use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone
          distribution;

        *  require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
          protect it at least as much as this agreement;

        *  display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and

        * indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
          including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your

    c. Distribution Restrictions.  You may not

        *  alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable
          Code;

        *  include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful
          programs; or

        *  modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
          that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An
          Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
          modification or distribution, that

            *  the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or

            *  others have the right to modify it.

- SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
  gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other

  support services for it.

- ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
  Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
  agreement for the software and support services.

- APPLICABLE LAW.

  a. United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States,
  Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
  applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
  principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims,
  including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition
  laws, and in tort.

  b. Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other
  country, the laws of that country apply.

- LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have

        third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

      * claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
        condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent
        permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
    possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply
    to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    incidental, consequential or other damages. Please note: As this software is
    distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are
    provided below in French.

    Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des
    clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

    EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE.  Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel
    quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril.
    Microsoft n'accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de
    droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des
    consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par
    le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d'adéquation
    à un usage particulier et d'absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.

    LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
    DOMMAGES.  Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
    indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US.
    Vous ne pouvez prétendre àaucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y
    compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de
    bénéfices.

    Cette limitation concerne :

      *  tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris
        le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes
        tiers ; et

      *  les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au
        titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d'une autre faute dans
        la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

    Elle s'applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
    l'éventualité d'un tel dommage. Si votre pays n'autorise pas l'exclusion ou
    la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou
    de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l'exclusion
    ci-dessus ne s'appliquera pas à votre égard.

    EFFET JURIDIQUE.  Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
    pourriez avoir d'autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
    contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays
    si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
